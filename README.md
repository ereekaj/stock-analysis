# Stock-analysis Challenge

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to improve the workbook created for our client, Steve. The original workbook used VBA macros to help Steve analyze 12 stocks. Now he would like to analyze much more data on the entire stock market. With a lot of data, the workbook may run too slowly, so I plan to refactor or edit the code to see if there is a way to do the same analysis but use code that will be more efficient in analyzing data in general.  

## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring code is that you can use less code that will run faster when analyzing a lot of data.  The disadvantages can be the time it actually takes to refactor the code.  I ran into a lot of problems and it may have saved time to just use the same code. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Steve wants to analyze the entire stock market over a few years.  According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange), there are 2400 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The original script worked fine for just 12 stocks over 2 years, but it's an entire different ballgame if looking at the entire NYSE over the course of many years.  Using refactored code will help Steve tremondously saave time and frustration if he doesn't mind waiting for a non-expert to create the code.
